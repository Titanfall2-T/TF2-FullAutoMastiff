# TF2-FullAutoMastiff
Makes the mastiff full auto (Use with grapple)

To use this mod you'll have to have NS setup for playing on vanilla or just regular Northstar (this is a northstar mod)

To use the mod, simply load in-game, equip mastiff and grapple, open console and type `fam_enabled 1`. If you have problems with the timing of grapple and mastiff you can change it with the `fam_grapple_duration` convar.

The `fam_attack_button` convar is just the key enum value for your attack button, by default it's set to 106 (mouse 1)
